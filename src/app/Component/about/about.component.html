<h2>What Is an ‘About Us’ Page?</h2>
<p>In short, it’s a page that can inspire people to work with you or buy your products. It can contain (but isn’t limited to containing) your brand story, your achievements, and your best testimonials.

An About page is not a place to push a hard sell or boast about your business. It should offer an up-front and honest portrayal of your company, its story, and your values.
</p>
<p>So when creating an About Us page, you should make sure to:

Stay away from the hype. Users can see straight through it, so leave it for social media.
Avoid a sales pitch. If a reader is on your About Us page, there’s a good chance they’re considering using your service or buying your product. They’re looking at why they should choose you. So don’t sell your product or service. Sell you.
Be creative. Don’t fall into the trap of simply writing a brief summary of your business and calling it a day. The best About Us pages are creative, informative, and interesting.
Don’t follow the crowd. If someone’s reading your About page, there’s a good chance they’ve been considering your competitors. So, make sure your page stands out. It should make it almost impossible for a potential customer to forget you.
Feature faces. Consumers often like to know who they’re buying from or working with, so be sure to feature at least some of your team members on your About page. It can really help boost conversions.
The bottom line is that people want to work with other people, not brands. You can use your About page to relate to users on a personal level and help them learn about your business.

How to Create the Perfect ‘About Us’ Page (4 Tips)
You should now have a decent idea of what an About Us page should and shouldn’t contain.

We’re going to follow this with a few tips to help you create a page that makes your business stand out.
</p>
<p>
<span class="badge bg-dark">1.</span> Tell a Story
One of the best ways to make your About page unique is to tell your company’s history. Often, stories can get visitors more invested in your brand and compel them to keep reading. And that, naturally, can lead to more conversions.

First, remember to be transparent. Your About Us page serves to sell your unique story and get buy-in from your visitors. Transparency is incredibly important to win your visitors’ trust.

You can talk about how your business got started, as well as your personal background. To help readers understand your goals, you can even write a mission statement. This text will vary depending on your brand, but it’s best to be as authentic as possible.

<span class="badge bg-dark">2.</span> Keep It Simple
When writing your About page, don’t use industry jargon and confusing copy. The words should leap off the page and inspire your new customers to take action. A block of text that visitors have to read six times to grasp is not going to cut it.

It’s also essential to consider your audience. New visitors will likely want a simple introduction to your business without having to read your entire life story. Ultimately, consider what readers will be looking for and make a value proposition with that in mind.

After you describe yourself and your company, be sure to add your contact details. If a visitor’s got as far as looking at your About Us page, there’s a good chance they’re thinking of working with you or using your service. Don’t miss that opportunity to convert them by making them search for a separate contact page.

Lastly, don’t forget about a call-to-action (CTA). This important element can convert visitors, making it clear what you want them to do next.

    <span class="badge bg-dark">3.</span> Use Engaging Visuals
If your About Us page has an aesthetically pleasing design, it can engage visitors and encourage them to read more. Readers may struggle to understand your story when the content is poorly laid out with too much text.

Since the human brain can process images much faster than words, consider integrating them into your About page. Even if someone doesn’t read the full page, they can view the other visual elements to understand your business.

Having the right design can avoid scaring away new visitors. Here are some great ways to improve your About Us page visuals:

Be creative and use original graphics.
Choose the right color scheme.
Include images and videos.
Create animations.
Use readable fonts for accessibility.
Ideally, all important information should be positioned above the fold. However, you can also guide users to scroll down and read more.

While it varies from industry to industry, more than half of internet browsing now takes place on mobile devices. So make sure your About Us page, and your site as a whole, is built for mobile first. Then, you can check if a page is mobile-friendly using Google’s Mobile-Friendly test.

<span class="badge bg-dark">4.</span> Make Sure the Page Loads Quickly
Whether you run a small business or a large company, your website needs to be fast. This is one of the best practices to improve user experience. If your About page takes too long to load, users will likely leave your site without reading its content.
